## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js (Hooks, Context API)
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (RTK)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Mobile-first, Responsive)
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **API:** FakeStore API (RESTful)
* **Storage:** LocalStorage for persistent sessions

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏗️ Global State Management (Redux Toolkit)
* Centralized **Cart Slice** to manage items, quantities, and real-time total price calculations.
* Decoupled business logic from UI components for better scalability.

### 🛡️ Authentication & Persistence
* Utilized **React Context API** for global User Authentication (Login/Signup).
* Integrated **LocalStorage** to persist user sessions and cart data across page refreshes.

### 🔍 Optimized "Master Data" Search
* Implemented a high-performance filtering pattern. By maintaining a **Master Copy** of the product list, users can search categories and filter by "Top Rated" (⭐) instantly without redundant API calls.

### 📝 Dynamic Form Validation
* Developed Support and Contact modules using **State-driven validation**.
* Used **Conditional Rendering** to provide real-time UI feedback and error messaging to guide user input.

## 💡 What I Learned

* How to handle **Asynchronous API lifecycles** using `useEffect`.
